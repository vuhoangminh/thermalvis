thermalvis
==========

Cross-platform, OpenCV-based functionality for image processing and computer vision in thermal-infrared.
For Windows, the recommended build environment is Visual Studio 2012, though it should work on others.

required dependencies:
----------------------

OPENCV
	recommended to download a pre-compiled binary installer e.g. from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/
	preferable to unpack the library at one of the following locations:
		"C:/Users/<username>/Documents/opencv/build" OR "C:/Users/Public/Documents/opencv/build"

optional dependencies:
----------------------

BOOST
	recommended version is boost_1_55_0-msvc-11.0-64.exe (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0/)
	may need to add the following to the System Path: 
		BOOST_LIBRARYDIR = C:\local\boost_1_55_0\lib64-msvc-11.0
		BOOST_ROOT = C:\local\boost_1_55_0
	beware of the directions of the slashes in the directory paths!

PCL
	There is no all-in-one installer for VS2012, or for the latest version (1.7.1)
	May want to compile from source:
		it's a GitHub project, at: https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl
	Try compiling from source and then let me know if you have any problems!

EIGEN
	can download from here: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
	preferable to unzip into C:/eigen (i.e. change the name to remove the suffix code)
		when unzipping, make sure you don't end up with a folder within a folder, such as: C:/eigen/eigen-eigen-6b38706d90a9
	if you get the following error when building:
		Could NOT find Eigen3 (missing:  EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR EIGEN3_VERSION_OK) (Required is at least version "2.91.0")
	then you may need to add the directory (e.g. C:\eigen) to the System PATH variable
	to rebuild, deleting the cache and reconfiguring is not enough - CMake must be reloaded for this change to take effect
	
troubleshooting:
----------------

NO DATA FROM OPTRIS PI450 IN WINDOWS
	launch the Optris PI Connect software, and verify that the camera is streaming correctly
		go to [ Tools -> Configuration -> External Communication ] select "IPC" and click "Apply"
	rebooting the Optris PI Connect software sometimes helps
	NOTE: often this problem is caused by terminating the program using the "STOP button" in Visual Studio

CORRUPT IMAGE FROM PI450 IN WINDOWS
	try shutting down the Optris PI Connect software, unplugging the camera, and then testing again
	
POOR QUALITY IMAGE FROM PI450 (ANY OS)
	try refocussing by manually rotating the physical lens
